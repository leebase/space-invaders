# Agent Guide: space-invaders

> **For AI agents working on the space-invaders project.**
>
> This project uses **AgentFlow** — a documentation-driven methodology for human-AI collaboration.
> Read this file first, then `context.md` for current state.

## Why This System Exists

AI agents are stateless. Every new session starts from zero. These project files act as **shared memory** between you, the human, and any other AI that works on this project.

When you update `context.md` at session end, you're writing a handoff note that lets **any LLM** — Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot — pick up exactly where you left off. Treat these updates as critical, not clerical.

---

## Startup Protocol

At the start of every session, in order:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (this file) — guardrails and operating rules
2. Read `context.md` — current state and what to do next
3. Check `result-review.md` — what was recently completed
4. Read `sprint-plan.md` — current sprint tasks and priorities

## Available Skills

Load the relevant skill file when the trigger applies. Do not try to remember — read the file.

| Trigger | Skill to Load |
|---------|--------------|
| You are implementing a feature or fix | `skills/development-loop.md` |
| You are about to test your work | `skills/test-as-lee.md` |
| You are about to commit | `skills/documentation.md` |
| You are creating a backlog item | `skills/backlog.md` |
| You are closing a sprint or preparing a release | `skills/code-review.md` |
| You are implementing any game entity (invader, player, UFO, bunker, bullet) | `skills/pygame-entity.md` |
| You are about to mark a mechanic, timing value, or scoring rule as done | `skills/arcade-accuracy.md` |
| You have implemented a mechanic and want to verify feel and accuracy | `skills/playtest.md` |

Skills are short, focused, and task-specific. They contain the judgment, not just the steps.

## Task Rehydration

**Before continuing any task mid-session:**

1. Re-read `sprint-plan.md`
2. Re-read any files you modified previously in this session
3. Confirm the objective — proceed only when you are oriented

Agents drift. This rule prevents it.

---

## Autonomy Modes

The `Mode` field in `context.md` controls how independently you work:

| Mode | Name | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| **1** | Supervised | Ask before every significant action. Explain plan, wait for approval. |
| **2** | Collaborative | Plan approach, implement with check-ins. Ask for approval on decisions, not on routine code. |
| **3** | Autonomous | Execute independently within guardrails. Report results. Only ask if blocked or decision has major consequences. |

**Default is Mode 2.** The human may change the mode in `context.md` at any time.

## Guardrails

### ✅ Allowed

- Write and modify code for space-invaders
- Create and update documentation
- Add tests for new functionality
- Research solutions to technical problems
- Update context and decision logs
- Create backlog items in `backlog/candidates/`

### ❌ Not Allowed (Without Explicit Permission)

- Add external runtime dependencies
- Make breaking changes to existing APIs
- Delete files without confirming necessity
- Skip tests or documentation updates
- Commit directly to protected branches
- Move files out of `backlog/candidates/` (human curates)

## Document Reference

| File | When to Read | When to Update |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Every session start | When conventions change |
| `context.md` | Every session start | Every session end |
| `WHERE_AM_I.md` | Every session start | When milestones reached or direction changes |
| `result-review.md` | Every session start | When work completed |
| `sprint-plan.md` | Every session start | When tasks complete |
| `sprint-review.md` | After sprints | External AI fills in review |
| `project-plan.md` | When direction unclear | Strategic changes only |
| `product-definition.md` | When scope unclear | Product changes only |
| `architecture.md` | When making tech decisions | When decisions are made |
| `feedback.md` | When given feedback | Human adds feedback |
| `backlog/schema.md` | Creating backlog items | Never (reference) |
| `backlog/template.md` | Creating backlog items | Never (copy-paste) |

## Communication Style

- **Concise**: Get to the point quickly
- **Specific**: Include file paths, line numbers, exact commands
- **Actionable**: Provide clear next steps
- **Honest**: Flag concerns or blockers immediately

## For Antigravity Agents (Google DeepMind)

If you are an Antigravity agent, map your internal artifacts to this project's documentation system.

### Artifact Mapping

| Internal Artifact | Project Document | Purpose |
|-------------------|------------------|---------| 
| `task.md` | `sprint-plan.md` | Track task status. **Read** project plan to populate your checklist. **Update** project plan when tasks complete. |
| `implementation_plan.md` | `architecture.md` / Design Docs | Plan technical changes. If the change is significant, create/update a design doc in the project as well. |
| `walkthrough.md` | `result-review.md` | Log results. **Update** `result-review.md` at the end of your session with a summary of your work. |

### Workflow Adjustments

1. **Session Start**: In addition to standard files, read `task.md` (if existing) and sync it with `sprint-plan.md`.
2. **During Work**: Use your internal `task.md` for fine-grained steps, but update `sprint-plan.md` for high-level status.
3. **Session End**: Ensure `context.md` and `result-review.md` are updated. Your `walkthrough.md` should summarize these updates.
